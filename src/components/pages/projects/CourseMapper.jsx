                In 2020, we encountered a myriad of challenges, notably
                <strong> restrictions on international travel</strong>. These
                circumstances demanded extra support for students in making
                informed decisions about their courses and navigating their
                academic paths. Course Mapper was conceived to{" "}
                <strong>ease the burden</strong> by offering guidance to
                students during these uncertain times. Its purpose is to{" "}
                <strong>assist students</strong> in selecting their units and
                completing their degrees seamlessly, ensuring a smoother
                academic journey.

                  Our goal for the project was to transform a paper-based,

                  seamless and easy online experience.

                    Course advisers often need to refer to a multitude of
                    information sources during the course mapping process. As a
                    result, a multitude of tabs—comprising web pages and local
                    files—inevitably clutter the workspace.

                    As students receive course advice from multiple advisers

                  I had the privilege of leading the design of the course advice
                  experience. This involved close collaboration with fellow
                  designers, as well as actively contributing to the front-end
                  development. Together, we crafted an innovative and

                    Our team of designers conducted extensive interviews with

                    Using this valuable insight, we mapped out the current

                    Using the insights from my research and analysis, I
                    facilitated multiple high-level brainstorming sessions to
                    uncover the root flow of the problem.

                  <div className={c.subDescription}>
                    Additionally, we addressed other pain points through
                    multiple brainstorming sessions, collectively striving to
                    identify the most effective and optimal solutions.
                  </div>
                  <div className={c.subDescription}>
                    In this example, one of the pain points lies in the
                    existence of hundreds of PDF course progression maps
                    maintained by faculties, each with different formats. As a
                    proof of concept, I manually mapped three courses to
                    showcase the potential value of our solution.

                    This approach emerged as the most cherished and widely
                    embraced feature among course advisors. Currently, with
                    dedicated resources and assistance, we have successfully
                    digitized thousands of historical PDF course maps.

                  <div className={c.subDescription}>
                    Now, we aim to initiate a new project to build digital
                    course maps from scratch, further improving user experience
                    and accessibility.
